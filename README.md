#COMS W1002 Computing in Context

Selected lab solutions, code, and tips for Columbia's "Computing in Context"
course, which is an introduction to programming in Python designed for
humanities majors.

The majority of the code here is written, commented, spaced, and bracketed in
a manner that is meant to make it's purpose and manner of execution clear to 
beginning, non-CS major coders. It does not necesarily reflect modern style 
guides or conventions, although I try to stay within them as much as possible
within the scope of over-explaining my code.
