COMS W1002 Computing in Context
================================================================================
Selected lab solutions and tips for Columbia's "Computing in Context" course, 
which is an introduction to programming in Python designed for non-STEM majors.

The majority of the code here is written, commented, spaced, and bracketed in
a manner that is meant to make its purpose and manner of execution as clear 
as possible to non-CS students with no prior exposure to programming. It does 
not necesarily reflect modern style guides or conventions, although I 
try to stay within them as much as possible within the scope of over-explaining 
my code.
