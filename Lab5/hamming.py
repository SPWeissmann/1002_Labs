    #Steps for project:

    # 1. For whichever string is shorter, look at each element.
    # 2. If the element being inspected does not match the element at the
    #    same index in the other string, change it so that it does
    # 3. When finished changing elements, add the remainder of the longer string
    #    onto the shorter string.
    # 4. Print to user what happens
