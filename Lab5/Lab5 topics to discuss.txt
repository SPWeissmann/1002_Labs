Topics to discuss

================================================================================

1. Function code is indented under function header/definition. On File 
   execution, the code there will not run on its own. It is simply available to 
   be called. Only code at the zero indentation level will be run. Not definitions. 

2. The basic concept of how calling a function works. i.e. how calling it will 
   tell python to go look for a function by that name in the namespace, and if 
   found it will execute the code indented under that function definition. 

	a. The only way to send data in and out of a function is through args
  	   and return. The program cannot "look into" a function, and once the 
	   function has returned everything inside it will go out of scope and 
	   be deleted anyways. Also, having a function alter stuff outside of 
 	   its scope (e.g. global vars) is bad practice.

3. Purpose of main function, need to call main from outside of function to run


4. Motivation for using a main function, and splitting up different parts
   of program into smaller functions and calling them 


5. Purpose of if __name__== "__main__":
	a. Very brief overview. Only really need to tell them that it stops code
	   from running if it's not the main file being run
