Problem 1:
The Hamming distance between two binary strings of equal length is the number 
of substitutions required to make them identical. So for example:
s1 = ‘1 0 0 1 1’
s2 = ‘1 0 1 0 0’
hamming_distance(s1, s2) = 3
because the strings differ at three specific spots. Write a function in Python 
that computes the Hamming distance between any two strings (not just binary). 

Problem 2: 
In your last assignment you wrote a program that involved palindromes. Write a
function in Python that determines if any string of any length is a palindrome. 
Be as efficient as you can.
